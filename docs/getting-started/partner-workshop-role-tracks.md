## Workshop Agenda

| Step | Activity                                                                                             | Time   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1    | [Workshop Overview](partner-workshop.md)                                                              | 30 min |
| 2    | [Set up Codespaces or local VS Code](partner-workshop-setup.md)                                       | 30 min |
| 3    | [**Plan, Envision, Experience, Architecture Design, Backlog**](partner-workshop-role-tracks.md) | 90 min |
| 4    | [Validation &amp; Solution](partner-workshop-solution.md)                                             | 30 min |
| 5    | [Microsoft Marketplace and Copilot Agent Store readiness](partner-workshop-publishing.md)             | 60 min |
| 6    | [Handoff to Implementation &amp; Commercialization](partner-workshop-implementation.md)               | 30 min |

Use this guide during the role-exercise portion of the workshop. Participants should work from the same scenario, capture assumptions, and leave with a handoff that the next role can use.

## Suggested role order

A practical sequence for the workshop is:

1. Subject Matter Expert creates the shared context.
2. Project Management turns the draft into requirements, priorities, and backlog structure.
3. Design translates that context into an experience draft and captures accessibility and responsible AI needs.
4. Technical frames the solution approach, architecture, and publication considerations.
5. The team reviews the handoff together during the solution integration step.

This sequence helps each role build on the previous one without waiting for perfect information.

## HVE vs Agile

| Agile                                         | HVE                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sprint-first and feature-first                | Outcome-first and value-first                             |
| Backlog refinement often drives delivery      | Shared context and AI-assisted planning drive delivery    |
| Teams often interpret requirements separately | Humans and agents work from the same context and evidence |
| Large feature sets can be explored too early  | Small outcome slices help teams learn quickly             |

## Track overview

| Track                 | Primary objective                                                 | Suggested output                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Project Management    | Turn context into requirements, priorities, and backlog structure | Requirements draft and backlog outline |
| Subject Matter Expert | Capture business facts, rules, constraints, and evidence          | Context pack                           |
| Design                | Express the user experience, pain points, and success criteria    | Experience draft                       |
| Technical             | Frame the solution, architecture, and deployment considerations   | Architecture and publication notes     |

## HVE Agent Guide

Use the HVE agents as lightweight helpers for your role. Start with your own draft, then ask an agent to refine or structure it.

* **BRD Builder** or **PRD Builder** for first-draft requirements and a simple structure for business outcomes, scope, and acceptance criteria. In this workshop, the Project Management role should typically own the BRD/PRD draft, while the Subject Matter Expert provides the business context, evidence, and constraints that inform it.
* **RPI Agent** for gathering, testing, and synthesizing evidence before the SME creates the shared context pack.
* **Functional Planner** for turning a draft requirement into a lightweight epic, feature, story, and task hierarchy when the team needs a delivery handoff.
* **UX UI Designer** for user journeys, pain points, wireframe outline, and experience artifacts.
* **Design Thinking Coach** for facilitation and discovery.
* **Design Thinking Learning Tutor** for guided learning and method support.
* **Accessibility Planner** for accessibility requirements and inclusive design considerations.
* **Accessibility Reviewer** for a review pass on accessibility readiness.
* **RAI Planner** for responsible AI requirements, risks, and guardrails.
* **RAI Reviewer** for a responsible AI review pass.
* **System Architecture Reviewer** for framing a simple solution approach, tradeoffs, and architecture notes.
* **GitHub Backlog Executor** for creating or updating GitHub Issues after the backlog is reviewed.
* **Security Planner** for additional review, risk checks, and readiness considerations.

### Getting Started Guide

> [!TIP]
> Across all roles, design for publication of your solution to Microsoft Marketplace and Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store. Publishing solutions to the Microsoft Marketplace is one of the fastest ways to scale reach, simplify customer procurement, earn rewards, incentives and GTM benefits, and create recurring revenue opportunities.
>
> Keep your outputs clear enough to support packaging, discovery, and review in both destinations.

## Subject Matter Expert track

### Objective

Capture the business truth before anyone designs or builds anything.

### Create Context

1. For your selected use case, gather available evidence such as policy documents, SOPs, process diagrams, notes, document references, PDFs, screenshots, and images.
2. For workshop case, keep synthetic or public source files in a manually managed `./copilot-tracking/research/workshop-input/` folder, organized by type such as `policies/`, `sops/`, and `process-diagrams/`. Keep original diagram files beside rendered images.
3. For an actual production case, do not copy customer, regulated, confidential, or production evidence into the repository. Keep it in an approved system such as a governed SharePoint or OneDrive library, Azure Blob Storage or ADLS with controlled access, an approved document-management system, or a secure data room. Confirm classification, retention, and access permissions, then provide `/rpi-research` with a trusted readable path or controlled links.

### Marketplace Lean Canvas as Workshop Input

Use this lean canvas as the SME's quick workshop input before the PM, design, and technical tracks begin. The purpose is to capture the business reality in a compact, shared format that the rest of the team can review and refine.

Keep each item evidence-based. Where data is unknown, write `Unknown` and note the source or decision needed. Do not invent customer segments, pricing, or metrics.

| Business problem or pain                                                                         | Target customer or user                                       | Unique value proposition                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What problem is expensive, risky, slow, or frustrating today? What is the cost of doing nothing? | Who is affected? Who pays? Who is the primary decision maker? | What makes this offering meaningfully better, faster, safer, or cheaper? |

| Solution or core offering                                                                                  | Distribution or channels                                                                     | Revenue model or value capture                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What is the offering, workflow, or service that addresses the problem? What is the minimum viable version? | How do customers discover, buy, and receive the offering? What channels and partners matter? | What are the revenue streams, pricing model, and commercial assumptions? |

| Cost structure                                                              | Key metrics and success measures                                                                                   | Competitive advantage or unfair edge                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What are the major cost drivers, dependencies, and operational constraints? | What metrics will prove value: adoption, speed, quality, cost reduction, risk reduction, throughput, or retention? | What gives this initiative a durable advantage: policy fit, workflow depth, data access, trust, low friction, or domain expertise? |

#### SME & Product Manager prompt to fill the canvas

```text
/rpi-research session-context=.copilot-tracking/research/[date]/[session-name]-session-context.md. Read the topic and evidence root from the session context. Use the business evidence, policies, process notes, and user-impact notes in the research artifact. Draft a concise lean canvas for an [FSI relationship manager assistant]. Capture the problem, target customer segments, value proposition, core offering, channels, revenue model, costs, success metrics, and unique advantage. Separate facts from assumptions and flag each unknown item for follow-up. Keep the wording grounded in evidence, not marketing language. Save the output under ./copilot-tracking/research/workshop-input/leancanvas.md
```

#### Output checklist

1. Problem statement with affected users and impact.
2. Target customer or user segment and decision-maker.
3. Value proposition grounded in business evidence.
4. Minimum viable offering or workflow.
5. Known revenue, cost, and operational assumptions.
6. Success metrics and business evidence needed to validate them.
7. Risks, dependencies, and unknowns the next roles must resolve.

### Start Research

1. Run `/rpi-research` on the scenario and available evidence:

   ```text
   /rpi-research session-context=.copilot-tracking/research/[date]/[session-name]-session-context.md. Read the topic and evidence root from the session context and the workshop-input. Research the supplied scenario, policies, process notes, and supporting materials. Identify evidence-backed business facts, affected users, business rules, constraints, known failure cases, AI guardrails, open questions, and credible alternatives or counter-evidence. Save the dated primary research artifact under `.copilot-tracking/research/`. Keep the scope to context discovery.
   ```

   For a production case using a locally synced, access-controlled OneDrive folder, provide the trusted evidence root explicitly:

   ```text
   /rpi-research session-context=.copilot-tracking/research/[date]/[session-name]-session-context.md. Read the topic and OneDrive evidence root from the session context. Research the policies, SOPs, process diagrams, notes, PDFs, and screenshots in that folder. Identify evidence-backed business facts, affected users, business rules, constraints, known failure cases, AI guardrails, open questions, and credible alternatives or counter-evidence. Save the dated primary research artifact under `.copilot-tracking/research/`. Do not copy source files into the repository; cite the source filename and controlled location in the research artifact.
   ```

   Use a OneDrive folder that is governed by the organization's permissions, retention, and classification policies. Do not use a public sharing link or a personal OneDrive folder for production evidence.
2. Review the generated research artifact at `.copilot-tracking/research/`. This is your permanent evidence trail.
3. Extract and record key findings in a context document: problem statement, affected users, business impact, business rules, known failure cases, and AI guardrails. Reference the research artifact for traceability.
4. Separate facts from assumptions, decisions, and open questions. Link or reference the supporting material when available.
5. If you need structure, ask **BRD Builder** or **PRD Builder** to draft a business or product requirements outline. Start by sharing your notes and ask it to create a problem statement, business goals, scope, assumptions, and acceptance criteria.

   Use **BRD Builder** when the team needs to establish the business case, stakeholders, outcomes, constraints, and decision context:

   ```text
   Select the /BRD Builder agent. Session context: .copilot-tracking/research/[date]/[session-name]-session-context.md. Read the topic from the session context, then use its evidence references and research artifact. Draft a concise business requirements outline covering the business problem, affected stakeholders, measurable business outcomes, scope, non-goals, business rules, constraints, risks, assumptions, dependencies, and unresolved questions. Save the BRD draft and its session state under `.copilot-tracking/brd-sessions/`. Separate evidence-backed facts from assumptions and proposed decisions. Do not invent customer facts, policy requirements, metrics, or implementation commitments. Mark the document as a draft for human review and include testable acceptance criteria where they clarify the business outcome.
   ```

   Use **PRD Builder** when the team needs product behavior, user needs, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and acceptance criteria:

   ```text
   Select the /PRD Builder agent. Session context: .copilot-tracking/research/[date]/[session-name]-session-context.md. Read the topic from the session context, then use its research artifact and business requirements references. Draft a concise product requirements outline covering target users, jobs to be done, user journeys, in-scope and out-of-scope behavior, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, data and AI guardrails, known failure cases, accessibility needs, success metrics, dependencies, and testable acceptance criteria. Save the PRD draft and its session state under `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/`. Preserve citations or references to the supporting evidence. Separate facts from assumptions, decisions, and open questions. Do not invent customer data, policy requirements, or unsupported technical details. Mark the document as a draft for human review.
   ```

   For production evidence, provide the approved source path or controlled link as context. Do not paste or copy sensitive source content into the repository unless the approved environment permits it.

### Deliverable

1. **Research Artifact** (`.copilot-tracking/research/`): Evidence-backed research findings with facts, assumptions, constraints, and open questions.
2. **BRD Draft** (`.copilot-tracking/brd-sessions/`): Business requirements, stakeholders, outcomes, constraints, and acceptance intent.
3. **Requirements Draft** (`.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/`): Product requirements with testable acceptance criteria.

## Design Track

### Objective

Translate the business context into a clear user experience and shared
understanding of the problem.

### Steps

1. Read the context pack created by the SME under `.copilot-tracking/research/`.
2. Add design evidence to the shared context before writing the final experience draft. Capture relevant user research, screen sketches, and wireframes in the same project folder so the next role can review them as part of the evidence trail. A practical pattern is:

   * Create a design working folder under `.copilot-tracking/dt/<project-name>/` for the scenario.
   * Add a short `user-research.md` with the study goal, participants, observations, key themes, and unresolved questions.
   * Add a `screens/` or `wireframes/` folder for lo-fi screen sketches, annotated mockups, or a link to a Figma file.
   * Add a `journey-notes.md` or `experience-draft.md` summarizing the user flow, key pain points, and decisions.
   * Label each artifact with evidence type, date, source, and whether it is observed, reported, assumed, or open question.
   * Keep customer or regulated data out of the repository; if a design artifact is based on protected data, reference the approved source location instead of copying sensitive content.

   Example pattern:

```text
.copilot-tracking/dt/<project-name>/
  user-research.md
  journey-notes.md
  experience-draft.md
  screens/
    home-screen-sketch.png
    account-summary-wireframe.png
  wireframes/
    customer-conversation-prep.fig
```

3. Use the research and design artifacts to ground the design decisions in observed user needs rather than assumptions. Keep a list of open questions and assumptions so the team can review them later.
4. Plan for a design thinking [**Microsoft AI Discovery Cards workshop**](https://aka.ms/AIDiscoveryCards) to brainstorm agentic AI capabilities with end users and stakeholders.
5. Select one primary user and one core job to be done.
6. Map the current journey and identify pain points.
7. Describe the future journey with the intended solution.
8. Add accessibility and responsible AI requirements.
9. If you need a first draft, ask **UX UI Designer** to turn the problem into a simple user journey and experience outline.
   Select the context pack under `.copilot-tracking/research/` and use this prompt in GitHub Copilot Chat:

```text
"Turn these notes into a simple user journey, experience outline, and key pain points for this scenario. Save the reviewed experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/`."
```

10. If the team needs a guided conversation, ask **Design Thinking Coach** to help frame the opportunity and challenge assumptions.

```text
"Coach me through a short design thinking session for this scenario. Help me frame the problem, identify user needs, and define a focused opportunity area for the solution."
```

11. If the team needs learning support or a clearer next step, ask **Design Thinking Learning Tutor** to explain the method and help transform notes into a simple design artifact.

```text
"Act as a Design Thinking Learning Tutor. Explain the next design thinking step for this scenario and help me turn my notes into an insight, opportunity statement, or user journey outline."
```

12. Use **Accessibility Planner** and **Accessibility Reviewer** to surface accessibility requirements and review the draft for gaps.
    Select the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` and prompt Accessibility Planner:

```text
"Review the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` and identify accessibility requirements, user needs, follow-up questions for implementation, and updates to the draft."
```

13. Use **RAI Planner** and **RAI Reviewer** to capture responsible AI requirements, guardrails, and review findings.
    Select the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` and use the **RAI Planner** prompt:

```text
"Review the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` and identify responsible AI requirements, potential harms, mitigation ideas, and updates to the draft."
```

14. If your team uses Figma, include links or references to Figma files, wireframes, and design artifacts in the experience draft. Use Figma outputs as evidence for user flows, screens, and design decisions, and note how those artifacts support the workshop handoff.

#### Connect Figma MCP and FigJam

Figma MCP is optional. It connects GitHub Copilot to Figma files and FigJam boards for design evidence, user flows, wireframes, and workshop handoffs.

15. Create or open `.vscode/mcp.json` in the workspace root.
16. Add the Figma MCP server:

    ```json
    {
       "servers": {
          "figma": {
             "type": "http",
             "url": "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
          }
       }
    }
    ```
17. Save the file and reload VS Code if the MCP server does not appear in Copilot Chat.
18. Start a Figma or FigJam action from the relevant design prompt, such as `dt-figma-export`.
19. On the first call, complete the browser-based Figma OAuth sign-in and grant access to the files or boards used for the workshop.
20. Reference the resulting Figma or FigJam URL in the experience draft, along with the artifact type, date, evidence status, and the user-flow or design decision it supports.

The Figma MCP server does not require a local installation. A Figma account with a Dev or Full seat on a Professional, Organization, or Enterprise plan is required for sustained usage. See [MCP Server Configuration](mcp-configuration) for the complete workspace configuration and troubleshooting guidance.

21. Identify and validate the use case for publishing to Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store.
    Select the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` and prompt UX UI Designer:

```text
"How would end users benefit from Microsoft 365 Copilot integrated to this scenario? What research would I need to run to validate it? Update the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/`."
```

22. Note how the experience should be packaged, discoverable, and reviewable for Microsoft Marketplace and Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store.
23. Define success criteria and unresolved questions.
24. Save the reviewed results under `.copilot-tracking/dt/` as the experience draft.

### Deliverable

`.copilot-tracking/dt/`: A user experience draft that captures the user path, pain points, and design constraints.

## Project Management track

### Objective

Turn business context and user experience into requirements, priorities, and a backlog draft with an implementation plan.

### Steps

1. Review the context pack in `.copilot-tracking/research/`, `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/`, `.copilot-tracking/brd-sessions/`, and `.copilot-tracking/dt/`. Align them to business outcomes, measurable success metrics, functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, out-of-scope items, and open assumptions.
2. Select **RPI Agent** and run `/rpi-plan` to turn the requirements and context into an implementation plan with phases and phase details. For example:

   ```text
   /rpi-plan Read `.copilot-tracking/research/, `.copilot-tracking/brd-sessions/` and `.copilot-tracking/dt/`. Create a lightweight implementation plan for the first MVP of the [Relationship Manager Assistant for FSI]. Include phase objectives, deliverables, requirements, dependencies, risks, and acceptance criteria. Plan for one evidence-backed job with grounded responses, source citations, permission-aware retrieval, clear uncertainty, human escalation, and confirmation before external actions. Align the plan to Microsoft Marketplace and Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store readiness, but keep publication claims provisional until current Microsoft guidance, Partner Center state, and tenant feasibility are verified. Do not implement or publish anything.
   ```

   This writes to `.copilot-tracking/plans/` and creates a durable record that links to your requirements and design context.
3. Review the generated plan at `.copilot-tracking/plans/` and refine phase details as needed.
4. Create a backlog outline only if it helps the team move from requirements to implementation. If needed, use a lightweight hierarchy such as epic, feature, story, and task for the first MVP.
5. Prioritize the first MVP with simple labels such as P0, P1, and P2 only if the team needs a sequencing signal. Keep this lightweight and outcome-focused rather than turning it into a rigid Agile process.
6. Prepare the requirements and backlog artifacts for publication readiness in Microsoft Marketplace and Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store.
   Select the context, requirements, experience and prompt **Functional Planner**:

```text
"Use the functional-planner skill and review the requirements under `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/`, the context under `.copilot-tracking/research/`, and the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/`. Create or refine a more implementation-ready MVP backlog plan under `.copilot-tracking/github-issues/` with clear epics, features, stories, and tasks. Then prioritize the MVP with simple labels such as P0, P1, and P2 only if they help sequence the work. Also assess publication readiness for Microsoft Marketplace and Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store. Keep the output concise, outcome-focused, and useful for backlog refinement."
```

1. If you are targeting GitHub Issues, ask Backlog Manager to coordinate the workflow and have GitHub Backlog Executor create the first parent issue and child issues for the initial MVP. The **Backlog Manager** should also ensure the resulting issue links and summary are recorded under `.copilot-tracking/github-issues/` for traceability.

   Enable writing of GitHub issues:

   * Authenticate GitHub CLI
     * Run: gh auth login --web
     * Or, if needed: gh auth refresh -h github.com -s repo
   * Verify authentication
     * Run: gh auth status
   * Confirm the target repository
     * Run: gh repo set-default [your git clone url]/hve-partner-workshop
   * Create GitHub Issues the backlog creation from a session that exposes GitHub write tools
     * If you are using Copilot or an agent workflow, make sure the session has access to the GitHub MCP write tools.
     * Refer to using [Using the GitHub MCP server from Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/copilot-for-github-tasks/using-the-github-mcp-server-from-copilot-chat)
     * Refer to [Using the GitHub MCP server in your IDE](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-mcp-in-your-ide/use-the-github-mcp-server)

   Prompt:

```text
"Review the approved requirements under `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/` and the backlog outline under `.copilot-tracking/github-issues/`. Confirm the target GitHub repository, create the first parent issue and child issues for this initial MVP, and record the issue links and summary under `.copilot-tracking/github-issues/` for traceability. Use labels such as P0, P1, P2, epic, feature, story, and task only if they help the workflow. Update the backlog plan and create the backlog in GitHub Issues."
```

1. Review the issue list for traceability from business outcome to requirement to backlog item, then save the final backlog summary and issue links under `.copilot-tracking/github-issues/`.

### Deliverable

1. **Implementation Plan** (`.copilot-tracking/plans/`): A phased implementation plan with objectives, deliverables, and acceptance criteria for each phase.
2. **GitHub Backlog** (`.copilot-tracking/github-issues/`): A backlog of features, stories, or tasks for translating business outcome to trackable work items, linked to the implementation plan.

## Technical track

### Objective

Frame the solution approach, architecture, and publication considerations aligned to the implementation plan.

### Steps

1. Review the requirements under `.copilot-tracking/brd-sessions/`,`copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/`, the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/`, and the implementation plan at `.copilot-tracking/plans/`.
2. Identify the core services, data sources, and integration points that support the phased plan.
3. Select **System Architecture Reviewer** to help frame a simple solution approach, major tradeoffs, and architecture notes that align to each phase of the plan:

   * Note deployment, security, and operational considerations.
   * Review the draft for well-architected design and Cloud Adoption Framework guidance.
   * Capture the publication requirements for Microsoft Marketplace and Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store readiness, including packaging, discoverability, supportability, and integration expectations.

   ```text
   "Review the implementation plan at `.copilot-tracking/plans/`, the requirements under `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/`, and the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/`. Create architecture notes under `.copilot-tracking/details/` covering a simple solution approach for each phase, major tradeoffs, cloud architecture, well-architected concerns, publication requirements, Microsoft IQ, and a Mermaid architecture diagram. Link the architecture notes back to the phases in the implementation plan."
   ```

   * Create a simple Mermaid architecture diagram by selecting **Arch Diagram Builder**.
4. Use **Security Planner** to review readiness and surface follow-up work aligned to each phase.

   ```text
   "Review this solution draft for security risks, deployment considerations, and follow-up actions needed for each phase in the implementation plan. Link any security-related work back to the appropriate phase."
   ```
5. Review the mermaid diagram and use natural language to refine it.
6. (Optional) Instead of GitHub Copilot, use **Microsoft 365 Copilot** to create an image. In M365 Copilot, attach the implementation plan, and create an architecture image from the mermaid diagram for this solution using Azure and Copilot-style icons to represent core services, data sources, user experience layers, and integrations for the first MVP.

   ```text
   "Create an architecture image from the Mermaid diagram for this solution using Azure and Copilot-style icons to represent core services, data sources, user experience layers, and integrations for the first MVP. "
   ```

   Save or reference the reviewed image under `.copilot-tracking/details/`.
7. Capture only the publication assumptions needed for the solution review in the architecture notes and link them to the implementation plan.

   * Select SaaS or Azure Managed Application as the preferred Marketplace model and the Microsoft 365 agent as a potential companion experience.
   * Managed Application: State what the components deploys, what the agent presents to users, and where each product boundary begins and ends.
   * Summarize the API, identity, permission, and data contract between the two products.
   * Record architecture constraints that affect solution, including data residency, tenant isolation, customer-controlled infrastructure, and least-privilege access.
   * List unresolved publication assumptions with an owner. Do not resolve commercial or submission details during the role exercise.

   Select **RPI Agent**,

   "Review the implementation plan at `.copilot-tracking/plans/`, the requirements under `.copilot-tracking/prd-sessions/`, the experience draft under `.copilot-tracking/dt/`, and the architecture notes under `.copilot-tracking/details/`. Update the architecture notes with only the publication assumptions needed for the solution review. Record preferred Marketplace model and the Microsoft 365 agent as a potential companion experience. Define the product boundaries and summarize the API, identity, permission, and data contract between them. Capture only architecture constraints, assumptions, unresolved decisions, and owners needed for solution integration. Link these inputs to the implementation plan. Defer the Marketplace implementation plan, offer validation, pricing, monetization, Partner Center configuration, package preparation, certification, and rollout planning to the Partner Workshop Publishing Follow-Up."
   ```

   Complete the detailed readiness assessment during the [Partner Workshop Publishing Follow-Up](partner-workshop-publishing).
8. Share the output with the rest of the team.

### Deliverable

1. **Architecture Notes** (`.copilot-tracking/details/`): Architecture design notes aligned to each phase of the implementation plan, including risks, tradeoffs, integration requirements, and the minimal publication assumptions needed by the solution review.
2. Publication planning input: The provisional product split, integration boundary, architecture constraints, and open decisions recorded within the architecture notes for the publishing workshop.

## Working session reminder

Keep the output concise and action-oriented. Do not wait for perfect
information. The goal is to produce a reviewed draft that the team can refine after the workshop.
